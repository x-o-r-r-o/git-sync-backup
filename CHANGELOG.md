# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-12) "Trust & visibility"

- Visual diff viewer: split on desktop, unified on mobile. Used in review, history, conflicts and "Compare with GitHub".
- Change-by-change conflict resolution in the "Ask me" dialog.
- Sync status panel: state, plain-language errors with fixes, pending local and remote changes, conflict copies, skipped files, device activity, API budget, schedule, tools.
- Review before sync, with per-file checkboxes (deferred files are left alone) and an optional "review before manual sync".
- Timeline: browse commits and snapshots and the files at any point; restore the whole vault or one folder as a forward commit.
- "Make this device match GitHub" (old versions go to the trash first).
- Incremental scanning: event-flagged paths are re-hashed; the config dir is walked at most every 5 minutes; a periodic full rescan; the UI is never blocked.
- Line-ending-only changes are ignored (option).
- `Device:` commit trailer; a pending-changes badge in the status bar; status bar click opens the panel.
- Tests: 45 unit and e2e, 11 live GitHub. Verified in Obsidian 1.14.4 desktop.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-12)

- Fix: stale HTTP cache could make remote files look deleted. Added no-cache headers and a stale-head guard (compare API).
- Live GitHub test suite; settings polish.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-12)

- First version: three-way sync over the GitHub Git Data API, diff3 merge, keep-both, delete guard, snapshots, history and restore, three modes.
